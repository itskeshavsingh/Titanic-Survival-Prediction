Project Overview:
A machine learning project aimed at predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using historical data from the Kaggle dataset. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation skills.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.

Model Building: Implemented Logistic Regression, KNN, GaussianNB, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix for performance assessment.

Visualization: Data insights and feature importance plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Jupyter Notebook
